#Project: Work on Your Data Story

# I am passionate about driving studies and in order to change a trend, the frist step is to get to know that trend
# It is a time series study and I was intersted to understand how violation changes during last years. Also, which months, weekdays, 
# and times drivers had more violations. 
# Furthermore, I looked at the fatal violations and alcohol related violations during last years, months, weekdays, and hours. 
# The database I used is avaiable on 
# https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/traffic-violations-56dda/resource/450018e7-f6c0-43fd-b5c9-a83de293b206
# it is mainly for MD state. 
# I used bar charts to plot the informations. Y-axises in all charts are percentage.

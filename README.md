# Spring_Repository

# Jason_exercise.ipyn is my homework which I did it by using python. 
# In this exercise, I worked with pandas and counter to process Json data. 
# Panadas was used to count items and also to fill the empty cells by bfill (after ordering the data.)
# I tried to use map instead of ordering, but I did not get result.
# The easy way to count items is counter, which I used it in this exercise.
